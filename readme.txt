HD Quiz Limit Attempts. Free addon for HD Quiz to limit how many times quizzes can be taken

== Description ==

# HD Quiz. The easiest way to create fun quizzes for your site

This is a FREE addon plugin for [HD Quiz](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hd-quiz/ "HD Quiz") and cannot be used on its own. HD Quiz 1.7.0+ is required.

See a live demo of [HD Quiz in action](https://designbypixl.com/the-ultimate-friends-quiz/ "See a live demo").

This addon will create a new Limit Attempts page for HD Quiz that will allow you to set the maximum number of times a user can take a quiz as well as set custom text for when this limit is reached.

You can also run the addon in three different modes: Logged in users only, all users, or hybrid mode.
